# Todo-App

In this poroject I learned more about localStorage and how to use it to save the Todo tasks to the browser so the tasks don't go away on browser refresh. I also learned how to preform CRUD opperations on the tasks and how to toggle between UI elements to change between the add task section and the display tasks section.
